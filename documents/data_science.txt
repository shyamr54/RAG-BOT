Data Science Complete Guide

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistical analysis, machine learning, 
programming, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from structured and unstructured data.

Data Science Process (CRISP-DM Methodology):

1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
   - Define business objectives
   - Identify key stakeholders
   - Determine success criteria
   - Assess current situation
   - Create project plan

2. DATA UNDERSTANDING
   - Collect initial data
   - Describe and explore data
   - Verify data quality
   - Identify interesting subsets
   - Formulate hypotheses

3. DATA PREPARATION (70% of time spent here)
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Handle missing values (imputation, removal)
   - Outlier detection and treatment
   - Feature engineering and selection
   - Data transformation and normalization
   - Data integration from multiple sources

4. MODELING
   - Select modeling techniques
   - Generate test design
   - Build and assess models
   - Compare different algorithms
   - Hyperparameter tuning

5. EVALUATION
   - Evaluate results against business success criteria
   - Model validation and testing
   - Review process and determine next steps
   - Decision on deployment

6. DEPLOYMENT
   - Plan deployment and monitoring
   - Implement model in production
   - Create documentation
   - Monitor and maintain system
