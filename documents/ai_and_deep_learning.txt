Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Guide

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are 
programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve like humans.

AI Categories:

1. NARROW AI (Weak AI)
   - Designed for specific tasks
   - Current state of most AI systems
   - Examples: Siri, Google Translate, recommendation systems
   - Excels in limited domains

2. GENERAL AI (Strong AI)  
   - Human-level intelligence across all domains
   - Theoretical concept, not yet achieved
   - Would match human cognitive abilities
   - Still in research phase

3. ARTIFICIAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE
   - Exceeds human intelligence in all areas
   - Hypothetical future development
   - Subject of ongoing research and debate
