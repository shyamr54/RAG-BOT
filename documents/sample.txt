Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. ML algorithms can be categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

- Supervised learning: Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Reinforcement learning: Learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback

Popular ML Libraries:
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
