Python Programming Complete Guide

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. 
It emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it ideal for beginners and experts alike.

Core Features:
- Clean, readable syntax similar to English
- Interpreted language - no compilation step needed
- Dynamically typed - variables don't need type declarations
- Object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming support
- Extensive standard library ("batteries included")
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Large, active community and ecosystem

Python Syntax Basics:
- Indentation defines code blocks (no curly braces)
- Variables: x = 10, name = "Python"
- Lists: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Dictionaries: person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
- Functions: def greet(name): return f"Hello, {name}!"
- Classes: class Car: def __init__(self, brand): self.brand = brand

Popular Applications:
1. Web Development: Django, Flask, FastAPI frameworks
2. Data Science: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
3. Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
4. Automation: Selenium, Beautiful Soup for web scraping
5. Desktop Applications: Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy
6. Game Development: Pygame, Panda3D
7. Scientific Computing: SciPy, SymPy

Package Management:
- pip: Python package installer
- PyPI: Python Package Index with 400,000+ packages
- Virtual environments: venv, conda for dependency isolation
- requirements.txt for dependency management

Python Philosophy (PEP 20 - Zen of Python):
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit  
- Simple is better than complex
- Readability counts
- There should be one obvious way to do it
